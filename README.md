Simple tweak of https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/addition_rnn.py
to make minor spelling corrections on male Indian names.

The set of Indian male names is taken from
https://gist.github.com/mbejda/7f86ca901fe41bc14a63

Intentional spelling mistakes are introduced using
codeIndianNames.ipynb.

Meant as a fun exercise for initial experiments
with LSTMs.
